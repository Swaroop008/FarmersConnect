## Introduction

The Agriculture Solutions Web Application is a powerful and user-friendly tool designed to revolutionize farming practices and empower farmers with data-driven solutions. This web application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flask, Python, and Machine Learning (ML) to provide essential services such as crop recommendation, fertilizer suggestion, and plant disease identification. With its intuitive interface and cutting-edge technology, this application aims to optimize agricultural productivity and promote sustainable farming practices.

## Features

### Crop Recommendation

Make informed decisions about crop selection with our advanced crop recommendation feature. By entering specific NPK values and your location, the application utilizes real-time temperature and humidity data fetched through a Weather API to provide personalized crop recommendations. Maximize yields by choosing crops suitable for your specific environmental conditions.

### Fertilizer Recommendation
