                <br>
                <li>
                <strong>Use slow-release fertilizers:</strong> Opt for slow-release nitrogen fertilizers that provide a gradual release of nitrogen over time. This helps prevent excessive nitrogen buildup in the soil.

                <br>
                <li>
                <strong>Improve soil drainage:</strong> Enhance soil drainage to minimize nitrogen leaching. Excess water can cause nitrogen to leach away, leading to higher nitrogen levels in the soil.

                <br>
                <li>
                <strong>Increase organic matter content:</strong> Incorporate organic matter into the soil, such as compost or well-rotted manure. Organic matter helps improve soil structure and fertility, allowing for better nutrient balance and uptake.

                <br>
                <li>
                <strong>Implement crop rotation:</strong> Rotate crops with nitrogen-fixing plants, such as legumes, to help naturally replenish nitrogen levels in the soil. Legumes have the ability to convert atmospheric nitrogen into a usable form for plants.
